/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for BitHired Application
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can access their own information. Public data,
 * such as mining machine details, is readable by all. Data denormalization is used to
 * optimize rule performance.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user account information.
 * - `/mining_machines/{miningMachineId}`: Stores publicly readable mining machine data.
 * - `/users/{userId}/rentals/{rentalId}`: Stores rental transactions associated with a specific user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/mpesa_transactions/{mpesaTransactionId}`: Stores MPESA transactions associated with a specific user.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users can only create their own user account.
 * - Users can only read, update, and delete their own rental and MPESA transaction data.
 * - Mining machine data is publicly readable, but write access is restricted (TODO).
 * - Listing of rentals and mpesa transactions are limited to the owner of the documents.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - The `RentalTransaction` and `MpesaTransaction` documents include the `userAccountId`,
 * which is used for authorization checks to avoid costly `get()` operations.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 * - User-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path to enforce clear ownership.
