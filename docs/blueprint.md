## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF), symbolizing trust, stability, and technology, reflects the crypto theme while remaining accessible and modern.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF), a desaturated shade of deep sky blue. It will serve as a calming, unobtrusive background, and makes the vibrant primary color stand out.
- Accent color: Purple (#A020F0), an analogous hue to deep sky blue, that can guide the user through key interactions or highlight data displays.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a techy feel; use 'Inter' for body text.
- Use a set of clean, minimalist icons representing machines, time periods, and cryptocurrency symbols.
- Maintain a clear, well-structured layout with distinct sections for machine selection, rate display, and transaction history.
- Use subtle loading animations and transitions to indicate mining progress.
